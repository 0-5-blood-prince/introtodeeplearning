        "\n",
        "In the second portion of this lab, we will explore two prominent aspects of applied deep learning: facial recognition systems and algorithmic bias. \n",
        "\n",
        "Deploying fair, unbiased AI systems is critical for long-term acceptance of these approaches. Consider the task of facial recognition: given an image, is it an image of a face? [Recent work from the MIT Media Lab](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v81/buolamwini18a/buolamwini18a.pdf) showed that this seemingly simple, but extremely important, task is subject to extreme amounts of algorithmic bias among select demographics. Another report \\cite{klare2012face} analyzed the face detection system used by the US law enforcement, and found that it had significantly lower accuracy among dark women between the age of 18-30 years old. These results are especially concerning since these facial recognition systems are almost never deployed in isolation.\n",
        "\n",
        "We'll investigate one approach to addressing this problem by building a facial recognition model that learns the latent structure underlying the and uses this to adaptively re-sample the training data, mitigating any bias. This lab is based on a very recent paper in which this approach was originially proposed.   "
