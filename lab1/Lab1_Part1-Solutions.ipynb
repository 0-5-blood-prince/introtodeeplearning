Under Eager execution, TensorFlow operations execute immediately as they're called from Python. This allows for fast debugging and a more intuitive way to get started with TensorFlow.\n",

Here's an example of the [Collatz conjecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture) using TensorFlow’s arithmetic operations. Such dynamic behavior is not possible in past versions of TensorFlow (up to v1.4)!"
